# Benchmark methodology

## Goal

Measure implementation performance without overstating protocol-level
comparability. Raw timings are useful only when the workload, security claim,
build, and machine provenance are explicit.

## Measurement rules

1. **Correctness first.** Every measured proof must verify. Adapters must also
   have a negative test that rejects a modified claim or proof before results
   are published. Workers with an in-process negative check enable it with
   `PCS_BENCH_NEGATIVE_CHECK=1`; these correctness runs use a separate output
   directory and are not imported as performance samples.
2. **Immutable dependencies.** PCS implementations and non-registry
   dependencies use commit hashes, never moving branches or tags.
   Harness revision fingerprints exclude `results/`, so archiving or regenerating
   output does not mark the source revision dirty. Other non-ignored changes,
   including adapters, scripts, and vendor catalogs, still produce a `+dirty`
   suffix. Historical records retain the fingerprints captured by their original
   harness; this rule does not rewrite their provenance or attest ignored
   third-party checkout contents.
3. **Deterministic workloads.** Inputs use documented seeds. Fixture generation
   and independent correctness oracles occur outside timed regions; any
   point-dependent claim or preprocessing supplied to the prover is included
   in opening time. SP1's pinned prover ignores its claim argument, so its
   independent witness evaluation is an untimed correctness oracle; opening
   includes interpolation of the batch evaluations returned in the proof.
   Peak RSS is `/proc/self/status` `VmHWM` of that worker process, including
   the dense witness. End-to-end runs default to `--seed-mode vary`, which
   records a deterministic seed per payload and process. Use
   `--seed-mode fixed` in a separate run to estimate machine/runtime noise for
   one workload; never merge the two modes into one aggregate.
4. **Separated phases.** Setup, commitment, proving/opening, and verification
   are measured independently. Whether setup includes preprocessing must be
   stated.
5. **Fresh mutable state.** A timed operation must not consume state reused by
   later iterations. Criterion's batched iteration is used when cloning or
   reconstruction must stay outside the measured region.
6. **Raw samples.** Keep Criterion sample data. Do not report only a rounded
   mean or a screenshot.
7. **Stable environment.** Disable frequency-changing background workloads,
   connect laptops to power, and use a fixed performance governor where the
   platform supports it. Record the scaling driver, governor, energy preference,
   and any thermal or throttling anomalies.
8. **No heterogeneous deltas.** Regression percentages require the same
   physical machine, target ISA, thread count, compiler, flags, and interleaved
   runs of candidate and baseline.

## Communication accounting

- Report the cryptographic commitment payload, opening proof, evaluation, and
  excluded verifier context separately. A self-describing archival or
  application envelope is not silently charged as PCS payload.
- `evaluation_bytes` counts only evaluations transmitted separately from the
  commitment/proof. Zero means the adapter's wire encoding already includes
  the evaluation; `None` means unknown. `Total sent` is commitment plus
  separately transmitted evaluation plus proof.
- Akita's catalog-selected `CommittedGroup` profile is verifier context. Its
  terminal PCS commitment payload is exactly 128 bytes; the larger
  self-describing `CommittedGroup` encoding is not the commitment-size cell.
- Serialization/deserialization time is a separate phase when measured.
  Reports state whether verification receives decoded objects or wire bytes.

## Cross-scheme comparability

A row is directly comparable only when all of these dimensions agree:

- claimed classical and post-quantum security;
- trusted, transparent, or structured setup model;
- polynomial type and representation;
- number of coefficients/evaluations, committed polynomials, and opening points;
- field and extension-field semantics;
- hiding / zero-knowledge mode;
- batching and recursion behavior;
- CPU ISA, thread count, compiler, flags, and memory limits.

When exact alignment is impossible, publish the mismatch beside the result and
label the comparison directional rather than equivalent.

## Lattice PCS comparison

The headline experiment is documented in [lattice-eval.md](lattice-eval.md).
Additional rules that apply only to that table:

1. **Single-threaded.** Set `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` and Greyhound
   `LATTICE_DOGS_THREADS=1`. RoKoKo has no native multithreaded prover; Akita
   and Greyhound are pinned to one thread so the ratio is not a
   parallel-scaling artifact.
2. **Process isolation.** One fresh process per sample. Discard warmup
   processes. The table reports the median and a conservative,
   distribution-free 95% confidence interval when the sample count supports
   one.
3. **90% address-space ceiling.** `scripts/with-memlimit.sh` applies `ulimit -v`
   at nine-tenths of detected `MemTotal` / `hw.memsize`. This limits virtual
   address space, not resident memory. Explicit allocation failures are `oom`;
   SIGKILL/137 without corroborating evidence is an unknown worker error.
4. **Do not bit-match RoKoKo.** Report the native
   `p-22`/`p-24`/`p-26`/`p-28`/`p-30` instance with the corresponding
   coefficient count, and say that the native field is ~50 bits.
5. **Catalog honesty.** If Akita has no generated schedule for a requested
   `nv`, record unsupported. Do not silently run a nearby size. For the
   lattice table, `nv=22` and `nv=24` are generated with the pinned revision's
   planner rather than omitted. Setup-offload rows use a separate recursive
   `fp32-dense` catalog from the same planner; a missing offload row is
   unsupported, not a fallback to the direct catalog. A recursive row with
   no setup-prefix edge is an error: that cell would not offload setup.
6. **Greyhound reference.** Use `LayerZero-Labs/greyhound-reference` at the
   pinned commit, not `lattice-dogs/labrador`. Run with
   `LABRADOR_SIS_SECURITY=l2-quantum128-adps16`. Report contextual proof
   bytes (public `u1` is verifier context). If the instance still cannot
   make Ajtai commitments SIS-secure, the cell is `err` with a footnote, not
   `oom`.

## Hash PCS comparison

The second experiment is documented in [hash-eval.md](hash-eval.md). Additional
rules that apply only to that table:

1. **Recorded security targets.** State the soundness notion as well as the bit
   target, and identify benchmark retunes. Akita uses its validated 128-bit
   Module-SIS and classical-ROM schedule targets. Plonky3 WHIR uses a 128-bit
   round-by-round target.
   WHIR uses Plonky3 `p3-whir` with `security_level=128` over the octic
   KoalaBear challenge field of the upstream PCS benchmark. The Johnson bound
   at rate 1/2 is used when the derived grind fits 30 bits (KoalaBear); at the
   current pin that holds for every size in this matrix with a 12-bit budget.
   The worker falls back to unique decoding if the Johnson bound cannot close
   128 bits, and generated tables footnote unique-decoding WHIR rows. The
   capacity bound is never used. Plonky2 uses its approximately 100-bit standard-recursion FRI
   tuple. Plonky3 FRI uses the pinned upstream benchmark tuple, approximately
   113.744 bits under the pinned random-words estimate; STIR uses the upstream
   fold-4 PCS benchmark schedule with its 16-bit opening-batching grind and
   validates an aggregate 100-bit capacity-regime target. Binius64 uses its product-default 96-bit
   unique-decoding query target. Flock uses its default Fast profile at
   128-bit round-by-round soundness. WorldFnd WHIR uses its 128-bit CLI-default
   Johnson configuration. SP1 BaseFold uses its 100-bit product parameters.
   The five changed profiles were remeasured on 2026-09-16 and are guarded by
   distinct record identities. Unchanged schemes retain earlier measurements
   from the matching environment.
   Akita uses the same validated `fp32-dense` planner schedule as the lattice
   table, plus `fp64-dense` and `fp128-dense` rows on the hash matrix (CLI
   `akita-fp64` / `akita-fp128`). Cells are not \(\lambda\)-comparable.
2. **Nominal payloads, native \(\log_2 N\).** Convert nominal field-capacity
   payloads by
   coefficient width (32-bit \(-5\), 64-bit \(-6\), Goldilocks \(-6\),
   \(\mathbb F_{2^{128}}\) \(-7\), Flock bits \(=\) payload). KoalaBear univariate FRI/STIR pack
   \(\log_2 N>23\) into height \(2^{23}\) because two-adicity is 24 at rate
   \(1/2\); footnote those rows.
3. **1 and 8 threads.** Each cell is a fresh process with `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`
   set to the row's thread count. A dash is an unsupported parallel mode.
   Smoke-check that Flock and Binius64 honor the env var.
4. **Process isolation and address-space ceiling** are the same as the lattice table.
   Record OOM; do not drop a scheme because one payload OOMs.
5. **Immutable dependency graphs.** Isolated Cargo trees keep those graphs out
   of the lattice workspace. Pins are commit SHAs, each lockfile is checked
   in, and builds use `--locked`. The
   Plonky2 adapter enables `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1` so `specialization` compiles
   on the workspace's Rust 1.95.

## Statistics


Criterion's bootstrap confidence intervals and outlier classification are the
default for microbenchmarks. Use at least 10 samples after warmup. Expensive
end-to-end cases should additionally run in fresh processes, discard at least
one warmup process, retain every raw observation, and report median and
95% confidence intervals. A regression threshold is not a substitute for
examining noise and absolute effect size.

## Result provenance

Published results must include:

- harness and implementation commit hashes;
- UTC timestamp;
- complete benchmark command and case identifier;
- CPU model, architecture, OS, logical CPU count, and memory;
- `rustc -Vv`, Cargo profile, `RUSTFLAGS`, and enabled features;
- sample count, warmup duration, and measurement duration.

Result records use one strict shape. Contract changes require replacing the
canonical records and generated reports.
